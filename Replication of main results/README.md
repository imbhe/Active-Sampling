# Active Sampling R Code

Code used for replication of main results in the paper Active sampling: A machine-learning-assisted framework for finite population inference with optimal subsamples by Henrik Imberg, Xiaomi Yang, Carol Flannagan and Jonas BÃ¤rgman.

Each script in this folder will execute the corresponding simulations for replication of Figure 3, 4, and 5 in the paper. The output will be saved in the current folder as "Replication of Figure X.png".

Please note that users may need to update their R and RStudio environments if they encounter error messages related to library packages.

* Replication of Figure 3 takes about 1 hour to run.
* Replication of Figure 4 takes about 1 day to run.
* Replication of Figure 5 takes about 3 days to run.
