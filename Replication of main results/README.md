# Active Sampling R Code

Code used for replication of main results in the paper Active sampling: A machine-learning-assisted framework for finite population inference with optimal subsamples by Henrik Imberg, Xiaomi Yang, Carol Flannagan and Jonas BÃ¤rgman.

Make sure that the boot, caret, magrittr, ranger, stringr and tidyverse packages are installed before running the code. 

Run "Replication of Figure4" and it takes around 15 hours to finish. When it finish, the figure4 in the paper would be replicated
under "Replication of main results" folder with name "Replication_95_coverage_plot.png".

Run "Replication of Figure5" and it takes around 2 days to finish. When it finish, the figure5 in the paper would be replicated
under "Replication of main results" folder with name "Replication_active_sampling_vs_importance_sampling.png".
