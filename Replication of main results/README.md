# Active Sampling R Code

Code used for replication of main results in the paper Active sampling: A machine-learning-assisted framework for finite population inference with optimal subsamples by Henrik Imberg, Xiaomi Yang, Carol Flannagan and Jonas BÃ¤rgman.

Each script in this folder will execute the corresponding simulations for replication of Figure 3, 4 and 5 in the paper. The output will be saved in the current folder as "Replication of Figure X.png".

* Replication of Figure 3 takes about 30 minutes to run.
* Replication of Figure 4 takes about 15 hours to run.
* Replication of Figure 5 takes about 2 days to run.
