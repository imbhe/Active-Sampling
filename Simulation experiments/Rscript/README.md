# Simulation experiments

Code used for the simulation experiments (Section 5) in the paper Active sampling: A machine-learning-assisted framework for finite population inference with optimal subsamples by Henrik Imberg, Xiaomi Yang, Carol Flannagan and Jonas Bärgman.

Contents
* simulate_datasets.R: Simulate data for the experiments. 
* Figure 2.R: Generate Figure 2 in the paper.
* Figure 3.R: Run simulation experiments for Figure 3, and generates Figure 3 in the paper. Takes about 1 hour to run. 
* supplemental_experiments.R: Generate the complete set of experiments in the supplement. Takes about 30–60 hours to run.
* supplemental_figures.R: Generate Supplemental Figure S1–S6 in the supplement.
* functions.R: Helper functions for the above.
