# Rscript for Application

Code used for the application experiments (Section 6) in the paper Active sampling: A machine-learning-assisted framework for finite population inference with optimal subsamples by Henrik Imberg, Xiaomi Yang, Carol Flannagan and Jonas BÃ¤rgman.

Contents
* run_simulations.R runs the main simulation experiments. 
* gaussian_process_active_learning.R runs simulations experiments for Gaussian process active learning.
* latin_hypercube_sampling.R runs simulation experiments using latin hypercube sampling.
* Figure 1.R, Figure 4.R, Figure 5.R and Figure S7.R generates the corresponding figures in the manuscript and supplement.
* All other files are helper functions for the above.

The complete set of experiments takes about two days to run.
